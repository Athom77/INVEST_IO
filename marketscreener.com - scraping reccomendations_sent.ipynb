You have to look at what\\'s really going on,\" Golub said.\\nThe growth rates for 2019 are much slower than for 2018 largely because the tax cuts fueled a sharp pickup in growth starting in the first quarter of last year.\\nThe lower tax rates added about 7 to 8 percentage points to earnings growth in 2018, but will likely have a negative impact of 1 percentage point on the first quarter, based on Credit Suisse data.\\n\"When you look at the taxes, we all made the assumption that the taxes were going to jump down (and) you were going to be left with a flat tax rate going forward. That\\'s mostly true, but it\\'s not entirely true. In fact, you have about a 1 percent drag on earnings coming from taxes,\" in the first quarter, Golub said.\\nThat is likely the result of the loss of one-time favorable items including accelerated depreciation of capital expenditures, which jumped in the first part of 2018, he and other Credit Suisse strategists said.\\nMoreover, oil prices went from being a support to an obstacle, while some top tech names are expected to contribute much less to the overall S&P 500 growth rate, Golub said.\\nApple last week said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street had expected as it faces weak demand for the iPhone.\\n\"It\\'s a small handful of things that are coincidentally happening at the same time,\" he said.\\nYear-over-year profits grew 26.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018, according to Refinitiv.\\n(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Chris Reese)\\nBy Caroline Valetkevitch'}, {'date_short': '2018', 'title': 'AI Startup Volley.com Gets Strategic Investment From JPMorgan', 'url': 'https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/JPMORGAN-CHASE-CO-37468997/news/AI-Startup-Volley-com-Gets-Strategic-Investment-From-JPMorgan-26944103/', 'date_long': '2018-07-17T13:47:03-04:00', 'desc': 'By Stephen Nakrosis\\nVolley, an artificial intelligence startup, has received a strategic investment from JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The group has risen an average of 4.1% in 2018, compared with the S&P 500\\'s 0.9% gain, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of S&P Dow Jones Indices data.\\nApple, the largest U.S. company by market value, said last week that it would embark on a $100 billion buyback program. The stock surged 4.4% the following day and 13% for the full week -- marking its biggest one-week percentage gain since October 2011.\\nMicrosoft Corp.\\'s stock rose 13% so far this year, after buying back $3.8 billion in stocks during the first quarter. Boeing Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and UnitedHealth Group Inc. all are up this year after big first quarter buybacks.\\nShare repurchases can play a key role in supporting stock prices because they lower companies\\' outstanding share counts -- driving up per-share earnings even without profit growth. They are seen by many as a reward for shareholders, particularly when other options for spending cash, such as acquisitions, don\\'t look attractive.\\nRising buybacks this year have been a crucial counterbalance to the rising tide of stock-fund redemptions. Investors yanked $29.4 billion out of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds tracking U.S. stocks in the first quarter of 2018, the most for any three-month stretch since 2016, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report citing EPFR Global data.\\nThe S&P 500 is up only modestly for the year. Yet many analysts believe major indexes would have suffered losses without the support of buybacks.\\nCorporations have long been among the biggest buyers of stocks -- making their share repurchases a major contributor to the nine-year bull market. Companies seized the chance to scoop up discounted shares following the financial crisis, with buybacks topping out in 2015 at $572 billion before leveling off.\\nNow with new tax incentives, share repurchases are ramping up again. The tax code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law late last year assessed a one-time tax on foreign earnings, meant to encourage companies to repatriate more than $2 trillion in cash held overseas.\\nWhile that cash can be used for any number of activities, early signs suggest that much of it is going into shareholder returns. Goldman Sachs expects S&P 500 companies\\' spending on buybacks and dividends to increase by 22% to $1.2 trillion in 2018, outpacing the expected increase in capital expenditures and R&D in 2018, which it sees jumping 11% to $1 trillion.\\n\"Activity is very widespread and we\\'re seeing it executed in a lot of ways,\" said Jake Mendelsohn, a managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who leads the desk that does corporate buybacks.\\nShare repurchasing has its critics. Mr. Munger noted that buying shares just to keep the stock up is \"insane and immoral.\" Some detractors say spending on buybacks can come at the expense of spending on research and development or upgrades for equipment -- things they believe are the ultimate drivers of growth over the long run.\\n\"For so long, productivity growth has been anemic or worse, and the plan has just been to pay your shareholders,\" said James Camp, managing director of fixed income at Eagle Asset Management.\\nBut as the trend continues, market giants aren\\'t the only ones that have benefited from buybacks. Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc., a real-estate investment company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., announced in mid-March that it would repurchase shares totaling $250 million, or about a 10th of its market value, over the next 18 months.\\nWithin five weeks, it had already blown through half of that total with a combination of private transactions and a program where its bankers buy shares on their behalf when they drop below a certain level.\\nThe buyback program, the company\\'s biggest ever in its decade-plus stretch as a public company, appears to be working. Though the stock had been volatile along with the broader market earlier in the year, it started rising pretty much as soon as the program began. So far this year, shares are up 14%.\\n\"The stock has been performing pretty well the last couple months relative to the rest of the market,\" said Matt Windisch, who oversees the company\\'s buyback program. \"Certainly the buyback played a role in that.\"\\nThe buyback strategy is not infallible. Amgen Inc., the second largest buyer of its shares among reporting companies in the first quarter, repurchased $10.6 billion of shares in the first three months of the year. Its shares are down 2.5% this year.\\nThat hasn\\'t stopped companies from continuing to pump cash into buybacks. Amgen expects to buy back between $2 and $4 billion more of its stock in the second quarter, the pharmaceutical giant said.\\nWrite to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com'}, {'date_short': '2018', 'title': 'Damp iPhone demand to pressure RF chipmakers, Morgan Stanley says', 'url': 'https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/APPLE-INC-4849/news/Damp-iPhone-demand-to-pressure-RF-chipmakers-Morgan-Stanley-says-25933489/', 'date_long': '2018-02-05T10:09:13-05:00', 'desc': '(Reuters) - Disappointing iPhone sales and a build up in Apple Inc\\'s (>> Apple) inventory would continue to pressure radio frequency (RF) chipmakers such as Skyworks Solutions Inc (>> Skyworks Solutions) and Qorvo Inc (>> Qorvo), brokerage Morgan Stanley said on Monday.\\nWhile the market for RF chips is expanding with the upgrade to 5G telecom networks from 3G/4G, iPhones account for more than a third of the market demand and a swing in Apple\\'s fortunes impacts RF chip makers more, analyst Joseph Moore said.\\n\"A miss in iPhone units shipments and big upticks in channel inventory points to additional supply chain cuts for the June quarter,\" Moore wrote in a research note.\\nShares of Apple were up 1.5 percent in early trading, while Qorvo\\'s were little changed and Skyworks dipped 0.5 percent amid a decline in the broader market.\\nApple sold 77.3 million iPhones in the key holiday quarter, missing Wall Street expectations of 80 million.\\nApple plans to slash its iPhone X production target by half for the first three months of the year, to around 20 million units, the Nikkei reported late last month.\\nSeveral analysts have cut their estimates for iPhone X shipments in the past few weeks, citing a high price, among other factors, for muted demand for the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone.\\nMoore estimates Apple purchases about 10 percent of all semiconductors, and said the broader chip industry would benefit with a pick up in demand for the iPhone.\\n\"Given Apple\\'s outsized influence, a reduction in their build rates and inventory could be the catalyst for industry conditions to loosen up.\"\\n(Reporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D\\'Souza)\\nStocks treated in this article : Apple, Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo'}, {'date_short': '2017', 'title': \"Tech still hedge funds' sweetheart sector - Goldman Sachs\", 'url': 'https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/APPLE-INC-4849/news/Tech-still-hedge-funds-sweetheart-sector-Goldman-Sachs-25557240/', 'date_long': '2017-11-23T04:21:39-05:00', 'desc': 'Information technology accounts for 27 percent of hedge fund portfolios, GS says.
